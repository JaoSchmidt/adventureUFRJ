# adventureUFRJ
Our initial intent was to build a simplified version of atari adventure. However, we decided to step back and build "Journey of the Prairie King", one of the minigames in "Stardew Valley"

//main.c is the program which has the main function. Has the menu.

//jogo.h has the function that initiate and executes the game itself

//player.h has the player's functions.

//time_elapsed.h has a special function that can detect time variations

//enemies.h has the enemy's fucntions.

//the alpha branch is for tests, do whatever you want there
